  A summer boredom spark turned into a style idea — just vibes and sketches for
  now.  Maybe one day it’s a brand, but for now, it lives in my notes and
  late-night thoughts.

Born out of a random summer thought and fueled by too much free time, this brand isn’t just about clothes — it’s about *vibes*. We’re not here to sell you just another hoodie or tee. We’re here to build a feeling, a moment, a mood. Something that makes you go *"yeah, this is so me."*

Our name? Catchy enough to stick in your head. The kind you hear once and think, “That slaps.” That’s because it’s made for *you* — the ones who scroll, dream, rebel, laugh too loud, stay up too late, and live life unfiltered. Gen Z energy, no cap.

Right now, we’re just an idea — the kind that lives in sketchbooks, Notes apps, and daydreams. But one day? We might just be your favorite fit.

We don’t just make clothes.
